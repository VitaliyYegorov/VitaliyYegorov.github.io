		<p>&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The java collection framework in the form of hashmap has been used in a program code. The hashmap, is an abstruct data type, which allows to store data in the abstruct memory storage even if the elements have equel values, that makes possible to calculate the total number of the similar values. Map allows to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs; hashtable does not provide the third option. Map also provides a safe way to remove entries in the midst of iteration; hashtable does not.
